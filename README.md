## 👋 Hi, I'm Mary
⚡ Once upon a time I was a chemist 🧪. Took a few crazy turns and now I'm in engineering leadership. I love people 🧑‍🤝‍🧑, all things STEM 📡, and food 🍽️. Happiest when surrounded by a community of innovators, creators, and problem solvers. 

🤓 Currently learning {fill in the blank... I still need to learn lots of things about everything}. 🙋‍♀️ Lifelong learner.

🎯 Intently focused on [zarf](https://github.com/zarf-dev) and [pepr](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/pepr) from [Defense Unicorns](https://github.com/defenseunicorns). 🦄
